If you are compiling code from SVN and the compile is failing because of 
missing dependencies, you need to run the command "ant initialize".  This
will load all the jar files you need from the ibiblio.org repository.

If you are using maven to do your build, it will download these jars 
automatically so there is nothing extra for you to do.
