This directory contains the resources necessary to run the jQuery JavaScript library unit tests.
Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of the jQuery library.

-------------------------
For 1.7.3-git (16 July 2012)

1.7.2 seems to have bigger need for PHP server, that's why git (snapshot) was used.

The directory was created by getting the sources from https://github.com/jquery/jquery,
then adding test/qunit from https://github.com/jquery/qunit
then adding src/sizzle from https://github.com/jquery/sizzle

There may be some cases which still need PHP server.

-------------------------
For 1.2.6
Created by checking out SVN source, building the release with ant, and copying the src, dist and test directories.

"Expected" files are generated by 'copying all' the text of the corresponding browser and remove the header and footer.
