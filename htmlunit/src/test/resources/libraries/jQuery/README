This directory contains the resources necessary to run the jQuery JavaScript library unit tests.
Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of the jQuery library.

-------------------------
For 1.8.2

Get jQuery sources from https://github.com/jquery/jquery,
test/qunit from https://github.com/jquery/qunit
src/sizzle from https://github.com/jquery/sizzle

    - Get JavaBridgeTemplate621.war from php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net
    - Deploy to a web server
    - cgi folder is created (e.g. WEB-INF/cgi/x86-windows)
    - Get php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip which contains php-cgi in its JavaBridge.war/WEB-INF/cgi
    - Add jquery folder to the web app 

    - In WEB-INF/web.xml: remove <welcome-file-list> section
    - Due to issue mentioned in http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29891268
        - In jquery/test/unit/ajax.js:
        - Change URL: "data/jsonp.php/??" to "data/jsonp.php"
        - Change URL: "data/jsonp.php/???json=1" to "data/jsonp.php?json=1" 

-------------------------
For 1.7.3-git (16 July 2012)

1.7.2 seems to have bigger need for PHP server, that's why git (snapshot) was used.

The directory was created by getting the sources from https://github.com/jquery/jquery,
then adding test/qunit from https://github.com/jquery/qunit
then adding src/sizzle from https://github.com/jquery/sizzle

There may be some cases which still need PHP server.

-------------------------
For 1.2.6
Created by checking out SVN source, building the release with ant, and copying the src, dist and test directories.

"Expected" files are generated by 'copying all' the text of the corresponding browser and remove the header and footer.
