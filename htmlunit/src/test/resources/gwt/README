This directory contains the resources necessary to run the Google Web Toolkit unit tests.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of GWT. Each of these subdirectories
was created by downloading the distribution and copying the 'www' of sample directories.

Notice that not all samples are included, because some samples require server-side implementation.
