                At any time, all the code in SVN should be compilable and should pass all the unit tests.  There
                is no guarantee that it will be full featured - this is a work in progress.

        <section name="Latest build">
            <p>
            You can download the latest build from our <a href="http://build.canoo.com/htmlunit">Cruise Control server</a> 
            kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.canoo.com">Canoo AG</a>.

        <section name="Checking out SVN repository">
            <p>
            Another way to get the latest code is through SVN.
            Create a directory for HtmlUnit (for instance c:\htmlunit or ~/htmlunit).  Change to that directory and execute the
            following commands.
            </p>
            <source>
svn co https://htmlunit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/htmlunit/trunk/htmlunit .
            </source>
        </section>

        <section name="Compiling the code">
            <p>
                Although it is still possible to compile the code with 
                <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> 1.5 or higher, the preferred way
                to build HtmlUnit is with <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven 1</a>.
            </p>
            <source>maven java:compile</source>
            <p>
                This will do an incremental compile of all the code.
            </p>
            <source>maven clean java:compile</source>
            <p>
                This will do a clean compile of all the code.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Running the tests">
            <p>
                All the tests are based on <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>.  The standard
                maven way of running the tests results in a large number of test reports which can
                be difficult to sift through to find failures.  The fast-test goal has been created
                to provide a quick run of the tests that dumps easy status information to the command
                line.
            </p>
            <source>maven htmlunit:test</source>
            <p>
                Calling htmlunit:test will force a recompile of the java classes if needed.
            </p>

            <source>ant build</source>
            <p>
                The build target will create a directory at the same level as src, lib and docs with the
                name "HtmlUnit-" followed by the version number.  There will also be a zip file of the
                same name that contains the contents of the directory.  Finally, there will be a zip
                called projectdocs.zip that contains all the generated documentation.
