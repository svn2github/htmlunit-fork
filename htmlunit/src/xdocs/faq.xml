			<question>
				I've found a bug, how do I report it?
			</question>
			<answer>
				The best way is to open a bug report in the
				<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=47038&amp;atid=448266">sourceforge bug
				tracking database</a>.  Sending a bug report to the mailing list runs the risk that the
				bug may get lost.  Putting it in the bug database guarentees that it won't.  Please
				search the bug database to see if your bug hasn't already been reported before opening
				a new one.
			</answer>
			<answer>
				If you know how to fix the problem then patches are gratefully accepted.

			<question>
				I'm having problems with cookie support
			</question>
			<answer>
				Cookie support is actually implemented in
				<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient">commons-httpclient</a>, a project
				in active development.  The odds are pretty good that whatever cookie problems you're
				encountering have already been fixed so you might want to try a newer version of
				their jar file.  If that doesn't help then post something to the HtmlUnit mailing list.
