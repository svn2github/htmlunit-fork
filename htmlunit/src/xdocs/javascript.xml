                Core language support for JavaScript is provided by the
                <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino">Mozilla Rhino</a> engine.  What HtmlUnit provides
                are all the browser specific host objects such as Document or Navigator.

                All of HtmlUnit's JavaScript objects subclass SimpleScripable either directly or indirectly.
                This class contains all the common methods needed by the HtmlUnit host objects.  Additionally,
                it changes the way that javascript method lookup happens.  The rhino engine doesn't walk
                up the class hierarchy when looking for methods starting with jsGet_, jsSet_ or jsFunction.
                SimpleScriptable changes this so that the superclass hierarchy is walked.

                Different browsers and versions of browsers support different javascript properties and functions.
                The file JavaScriptConfiguration.xml contains all of this browser specific information.  The plan
                is to have properties and functions present or not based on the information in this file.  Today
                not all of that support is present.
