                Fixed bug where HtmlPage.asText() would blow up if form tags were
                found between tr and td tags.  Clearly this is illegal html but
                the browsers support it so HtmlUnit needs to as well.

                Add support for getting HTMLElement.firstChild, lastChild,
                nextSibling and previousSibling.  HTMLElement.firstChild returns
                the first node below the current node.  HTMLElement.lastChild
                returns the last node below the current node.  HTMLElement.nextSibling
                returns the node after the current node.  HTMLElement.previousSibling
                returns the node before the current node.  They each return null
                if there is no such node or the node type is not supported (not HTML).

            <action type="update" dev="dktaylor">
                Add support for HTMLElement.removeChild and insertBefore.
                HTMLElement.removeChild removes an Element from the HTML document.
                It returns the removed Element which is no longer part of the HTML
                document.  HTMLElement.insertBefore adds a new child element before
                another child element.  It returns the newly added child element.
            </action>
            <action type="update" dev="dktaylor" id="805051">

                data nodes including the data and length properties and
                appendData, deleteData, insertData, replaceData, substringData
                and splitText functions.  Updated DOM API properties and
                methods of HTMLElement to work with text nodes.  Also added
                support for HTMLElement.nodeType, nodeName and nodeValue
                properties.

                onClick attribute.  This includes image.  Removed extra
                non-standard attributes (onClick, etc.) from BDO element.

                The html spec doesn't seem clear on this but Internet Explorer and Mozilla
                both allow the form to be submitted no matter what is returned from
                Input.onclick.
