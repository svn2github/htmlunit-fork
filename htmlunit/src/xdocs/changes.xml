		<change type="new">
			Added support for document.location (an alias for window.location)
		</change>
		<change type="change">
			Changed initialization order in HtmlPage so that the enclosing window
			is initialized before the javascript is run
		</change>
		<change type="change">
			BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: WebClients may no longer change browser versions after creation.
			This is required because some of the javascript bits initialize differently
			depending on which browser is in use.  If we allowed the browser version to
			change then behaviour would be very unpredictable.
		</change>

		</change>
		<change type="change">
			Changed SimpleScriptable.getLog() to create a new log object each time.  This is
			neccessary since in rhino, functions don't know who their object is.  A way for
			functions to learn about their objects will have to be determined.
		</change>
		<change type="new">
			Added a javascript style object
		</change>
		<change type="new">
			Added new method HtmlElement.isAttributeDefined()
		</change>
		<change type="change">

			When checking to see if a script is javascript we previously assumed that the
			script was not and then looked for proof that it was.  This gives us behaviour

			is proof otherwise.
