                Fixed the bug where newly opened windows targetted at named
                frames were not opening in the correct windows.

                Changed returned page from click() method to work with new
                targets.  That is, instead of just returning changes to the
                immediate window, it returns any window that is opened.  So,
                if you call click() on an element that has a target set, you
                will get the page in the window for that target.  This is
                particularly needed for the _blank target where you couldn't
                find the new window without this change since it is not named.
