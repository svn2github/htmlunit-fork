<section title="Creating a WebClient">
	<p>
		The class <javadoc>com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient</javadoc> is the
		main starting point.  This simulates a web browser and will be used to execute
		all of the tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most unit testing will be done within a framework like <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>
		so all the examples here will assume that we are using that.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first sample, we create the web client and have it load the homepage from the HtmlUnit website.
		We then verify that this page has the correct title.  Note that getPage() can return different types
		of pages based on the content type of the returned data.  In this case we are expecting a content
		type of text/html so we cast the result to an <javadoc>com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlPage</javadoc>.
	</p>
	<source><![CDATA[
public void testHomePage() throws Exception {
	final WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
	final URL url = new URL("http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net");
	final HtmlPage page = (HtmlPage)webClient.getPage(url);
	assertEquals( "Welcome to HtmlUnit", page.getTitleText();
}
	]]></source>

<section title="Imitating a specific browser">
	<p>
		Often you will want to simulate a specific browser.  This is done by passing a
		<javadoc>com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.BrowserVersion</javadoc> into the WebClient constructor.
		Constants have been provided for some common browsers but you can create your own specific
		version by instantiating a BrowserVersion.
	</p>
	<source><![CDATA[
public void testHomePage() throws Exception {
	final WebClient webClient = new WebClient(BrowserVersion.MOZILLA_1_0);
	final URL url = new URL("http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net");
	final HtmlPage page = (HtmlPage)webClient.getPage(url);
	assertEquals( "Welcome to HtmlUnit", page.getTitleText();
}
	]]></source>
	<p>
		Specifying this BrowserVersion will change the user agent header that is sent up to the
		server and will change the behaviour of some of the javascript.  Note that the version
		specific javascript behaviour still needs a lot of work.
	</p>
</section>


<section title="Using a proxy server">
	<p>
		The last WebClient constructor allows you to specify proxy server information in those cases
		where you need to connect through one.
	</p>
	<source><![CDATA[
public void testHomePage() throws Exception {
	final WebClient webClient = new WebClient(BrowserVersion.MOZILLA_1_0, "http://myproxyserver", 8000);
	final URL url = new URL("http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net");
	final HtmlPage page = (HtmlPage)webClient.getPage(url);
	assertEquals( "Welcome to HtmlUnit", page.getTitleText();
}
	]]></source>

		Specifying this BrowserVersion will change the user agent header that is sent up to the

		specific javascript behaviour still needs a lot of work.

<section title="Submitting a form">
	<p>
		Frequently we want to change values in a form and submit the form back to the server.  The
		following example shows how you might do this.
	</p>
	<source><![CDATA[
public void testHomePage() throws Exception {
	final WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
	final URL url = new URL("http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net");

	// Get the first page
	final HtmlPage page1 = (HtmlPage)webClient.getPage(url);

	// Get the form that we are dealing with and within that form, find the submit button
	// and the field that we want to change.
	final HtmlForm form = page1.getFormByName("myform");
	final HtmlSubmitInput button = (HtmlSubmitInput)form.getInputByName("submitbutton");
	final HtmlTextInput textField = (HtmlTextInput)form.getInputByName("userid");

	// Change the value of the text field
	textField.setValueAttribute("root");

	// Now submit the form by clicking the button and get back the second page.
	final HtmlPage page2 = (HtmlPage)button.click();
}
