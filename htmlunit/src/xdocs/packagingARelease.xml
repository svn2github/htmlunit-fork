                This document is intended for committers who are packaging a release.  It likely won't be
                of much use to anyone else.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Update the version number in project.xml
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update the version number and release date in changes.xml
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build the zip
                        <source>maven clean buildzip</source>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upload that zip to SourceForge following 
                        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&amp;group_id=1">
                        these instructions</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assuming that everything has gone smoothly so far, make sure everything is checked
                        in and tag the repository with a name like this "HtmlUnit-1dot1" that reflects
                        the current build version.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increment the version number in project.xml to indicate that the docs are now
                        reflecting a future version and not what what had been released.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rebuild and redeploy the site documentation.
                        <source>maven site:deploy</source>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Deploy this new version to the maven repository as 
                        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/repository-upload.html">described here</a>
                    </li>
