                Building HtmlUnit from the SVN repository will give you the latest version of the code.  At
                any time, all the code in SVN should be compilable and should pass all the unit tests.  There
                is no guarantee that it will be full featured - this is a work in progress.

        <section name="Latest build">
            <p>
            You can get the latest build as a downloadable file from <a href="http://build.canoo.com/htmlunit">here</a>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Checking out">
            <p>
            Create a directory for HtmlUnit (for instance c:\htmlunit or ~/htmlunit).  Change to that directory and execute the
            following commands.
            </p>
            <source>
svn co https://htmlunit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/htmlunit/trunk/htmlunit .
            </source>
        </section>

        <section name="Compiling the code">
            <p>
                Although it is still possible to compile the code with 
                <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> 1.5 or higher, the preferred way
                to build HtmlUnit is with <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven 1</a>.
            </p>
            <source>maven java:compile</source>
            <p>
                This will do an incremental compile of all the code.
            </p>
            <source>maven clean java:compile</source>
            <p>
                This will do a clean compile of all the code.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Running the tests">
            <p>
                All the tests are based on <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>.  The standard
                maven way of running the tests results in a large number of test reports which can
                be difficult to sift through to find failures.  The fast-test goal has been created
                to provide a quick run of the tests that dumps easy status information to the command
                line.
            </p>
            <source>maven htmlunit:test</source>
            <p>
            	Calling htmlunit:test will force a recompile of the java classes if needed.
            </p>

            <source>ant build</source>
            <p>
                The build target will create a directory at the same level as src, lib and docs with the
                name "HtmlUnit-" followed by the version number.  There will also be a zip file of the
                same name that contains the contents of the directory.  Finally, there will be a zip
                called projectdocs.zip that contains all the generated documentation.
