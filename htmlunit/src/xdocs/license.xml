		Starting with 1.1-pre4, HtmlUnit is licensed under an Apache style license.  The full
		contents of this license are below.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to 1.1-pre4, HtmlUnit was licensed under the
		<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">LGPL</a>.
		This change in license was done to ensure that HtmlUnit
		could be used by the greatest number of projects possible.  There is a fair bit
		of general confusion about the viral nature of the LGPL so the license for
		HtmlUnit has been changed to one that is generally better understood.
