        <section>
            <p>
                This page outlines the coding conventions used in HtmlUnit.  If you wish to contribute
                code to this project then the code will be expected to follow these conventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of having common coding conventions is to make the code easier to understand
                and therefore more easily maintained.  I have worked on far too many projects where over
                time the code became brittle or difficult to maintain.  The conventions in this document
                are the best practices that I have adopted over time to keep the code easily maintainable
                and robust.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net">checkstyle</a> to check as many coding
                conventions as possible.  Things covered by checkstyle are only documented below if we feel
                that they require explanation.  You can run checkstyle with the following ant target.
                <source>ant checkstyle</source>
            </p>

        <section name="Unit tests">
            <p>
                All code must have 100% automated test coverage using the <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>
                testing framework.  I strongly suggest that you write the code test-first but I'll be happy
                as long as there are full tests for everything.  Run the tests with the following ant target.
                <source>ant junit</source>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a couple of tests that hit live web servers as a final sanity check but the vast
                majority of tests do not.
            </p>

        <section name="Abbreviations">
            <p>
                Abbreviations obscure meaning and therefore they are not to be used in variable/method names.
                If you saw the following code, would you have any idea what it was doing?
            </p>
            <source>cob.getTrh()</source>
            <p>
                I didn't either - this was code that I found while debugging something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some abbreviations that are so common that it doesn't make sense to exclude them. The
                following list contains all those abbreviations that are allowed.  If it isn't in this list,
                it isn't allowed.
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Abbreviation</td>
                        <td>Description</td>
                        <td>Comments</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Util</td>
                        <td>Utility</td>
                        <td>Used only in class names.  ie StringUtil</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>e</td>
                        <td>Exception</td>
                        <td>Used only in catch blocks.  ie catch( MyException e )</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>i</td>
                        <td>Loop variable</td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                How do you add an abbreviation to the list?  Bring it up on the mailing list and if none of
                the other maintainers object to it then it gets added.
            </p>

        <section name="The final keyword">
            <p>
                The final keyword should be used wherever possible.  It provides information to the
                compiler about your intended use of the code.  This allows the compiler to generate
                move efficient code and identify potential errors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Declare a variable to be final to indicate that it will only be assigned a value once.
                Final instance variables must have been given a value by the end of the last constructor.
                Final static variables must have been given a value by the end of the last static block.
                Final local variables must have been given a value before being used.
                <source>private final int fooCount = 12;</source>
            </p>

            <p>
                Declare method parameters method final to indicate that they will not be changed.
                <source>public void setFooList( final List fooList ) {</source>
            </p>

            <p>
                Declare a method final to indicate that it may not be overridden
                <source>public final int getFooCount() {</source>
            </p>

            <p>
                Declare a class final to indicate that it may not be subclassed
                <source>public final class FooCounter {</source>
            </p>
        </section>


        <section name="Import statements">
            <p>
                Use fully qualified import statements not wildcards.  In other words, use
            </p>
            <source>
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
            </source>
            <p>
            Instead of
            </p>
            <source>import java.util.*;</source>
            <p>
                Fully qualified import statements make it much easier to maintain the source.  When I'm
                trying to learn someone else's code, one of the first things I do is expand all the .*
                imports so that I can figure out what class came from where.  If they're already
                expanded then it makes it much easier to understand the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                A common complaint about this convention is "how will I know if an import isn't needed
                anymore?".  The answer is, use checkstyle.  It will warn you about unused import statements.
            </p>

        <section name="Indenting">
            <p>
                Indent by using spaces, not tabs.  Indent four (4) spaces at a time.
            </p>
