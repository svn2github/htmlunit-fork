- LookupSetterTest: was failing. typeof() was fixed, but toStringConversion still fails.
- StackTraceTest: was and still failing
- ExceptionMessageTest.testOnlyGetterError() : the is no use of 'feature' parameter at all
- WriteReadOnlyPropertyTest: there is System.out, should this be used in assertion?
- If a 'feature' is always true by HtmlUnit, why we are making it configurable?
  Is htmlunit fork is meant to be used as plain 'rhino'?
