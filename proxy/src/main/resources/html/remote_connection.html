The PAW Server can reside on a different machine than the PAW GUI.
This means that it is possible to administer more than one PAW Server by
using the same GUI.
<br><p>
To connect to a remote Server select <b><tt>New Connection</tt></b> from
the dropdown list in the toolbar and press the
<img src="images/connect.png"  alt="" border="0">button.
<p>
The following dialog box appears:
<p>
<center>

<p>
Fill out the hostname and port field.
The port that has to be specified is the PAW Admin-Serve port, not the port of
the PAW Server (the standard port for the PAW Admin-Server is <tt>4444</tt>).
<p>
In the next dialog fill in username and password.
<p>
<center>

<p>
The standard user is <tt>admin</tt> and the standard password is <tt>paw</tt>
<br>
You should change this as soon as possible to have a secure site.
<p>
If everything works out fine, you will se the tree-view of the connected server.
<p>
All successfull logins are remembered in the file <tt>hosts</tt> in your
PAW install directory on exiting PAW.
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
Within GUI sessions login information to different hast will be stored. <br>
So if changing hosts within the same session, you don't have to provide user
and password information again.
