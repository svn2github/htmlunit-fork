PAW (pro-active webfilter) is an Open-Source
filtering HTTP proxy based on the  Brazil Framework provided as a Open-Source Project by SUN.
Because the Brazil Framework and PAW are written in Java the software is highly portable.
<p>
PAW allows for easy plugin of Handlers (filter outgoing requests) and Filters
(filter incoming data - the HTML response) and a GUI for end users.
All the configuration files are in XML-Format and thus easy to modify (even
without the GUI).
<p>
It's aim is to provide an easy to use interface for end users and to be easily extendable
by developers.

PAW consists of the followig components:
<ul>
  <li>PAW Server which implements the filtering HTTP Proxy. <br>
      For Installation instructions see
	  <a href="starting_server.html">Starting the server</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
      PAW GUI for easy PAW Server administration. <br>
	  For Installation instructions see
	  <a href="starting_gui.html">Starting the GUI</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
PAW is published under a <a href="license.html">modified Apache License</a>
to be as open as possible.
<p>
Internally the following Java components are used:
<ul>
<li>SUN Brazil Framework</li>
<li>JDOM</li>
<li>Xerces</li>
</ul>
<p>
The documentation is far from being complete, so we apologize if there are
things missing and hope that is will get better in later versions.
